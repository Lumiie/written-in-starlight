# written-in-starlight-ao3-site-skin
An elegant, minimalist AO3 site skin with a dark starry night theme, warm gold accents, designed for midnight reading sessions. (works best on horizontal view on bigger screens, ipads, laptops, e.t.c)

I'm updating the skin pretty often to improve it, make sure to check back if you're interested in future versions!

* Soft yellow-tinted text that’s easy on the eyes, especially during late-night reading sessions.

* A clean, uncluttered reading experience, free from harsh contrasts and busy visuals.

* Faithful to AO3’s original design, no major structural UI changes.
