* Elegant gold accents reminiscent of constellations.

* Soft yellow-tinted text that’s easy on the eyes, especially during late-night reading sessions.

* A clean, uncluttered reading experience, free from harsh contrasts and busy visuals.

* Faithful to AO3’s original design, no major structural UI changes.

Perfect for late-night reading sessions, rainy-day reading, or escaping into imagined worlds under a blanket of stars.
